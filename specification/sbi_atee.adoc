=== TEEI - TH-ABI runtime interface 

ECALL invocation from VS (guest OS) causes traps that are handled by the 
TSM module (enforced via mdeleg configuration). The TSM then may provide 
intrinsics via the TG-ABI (TEE-Guest ABI) to the TVM to provide attestation 
and other trusted services. The TSM may allow the TEE (application or VM) 
to request host (untrusted) services via the TH-ABI (TEE host-ABI). As 
shown in the figure above, the TEE Runtime (operating in VS-mode) supports 
applications as TEEs when the host environment is a baremetal OS (not 
running a VMM).

The following operations must be implemented by the TSM ( _Formal input 
parameters and return codes are TBD_ ).

|===
| *TSM load and initialization operations* | 

| teecall_tsm_info                              | Used by the OS/VMM to 
discover if a TSM is loaded and initialized else returns an error. If a TSM 
is loaded and initialized, this operation is used to enumerate TSM 
information such as: TEE-capable memory regions, Size of static memory to 
allocate per TVM, Size of memory to allocate per TVM Virtual Hart and so on. 

| teecall_tsm_load                              | Used by the OS/VMM to load 
a TSM binary image into TSM-memory region. Pages used for TSM will be 
declared as part of this function to load the TSM. Loading and updates 
to the TSM should be done via the TSM-driver teecall_tsm_update interface. 

| teecall_tsm_init_global                       | Perform a global state 
initialization of the TSM after a load or update. This operation and the 
following should succeed before the TSM is considered ready to service 
other TVM operations.

| teecall_tsm_init_local                        | Perform a local 
(per-hart) initialization of TSM after the global init has been 
performed.This operation and the above should succeed before the TSM is 
considered ready to service other TVM 
operations.                                                                  

| teecall_tsm_update                            | Update TSM binary and/or 
configuration. Ideally this operation should be performed without shutting 
down the TVMs, however all TVMs have to be paused before an update can be 
issued. The TSM update process description is 
TBD.                                                                         

| teecall_tsm_shutdown                          | Shuts down the TSM.All 
TVMs must be shutdown and all TVM memory must be reclaimed before this 
operation can 
succeed.                                                                     
    
| *TVM global operations*  |

| teecall_tvm_create_init                       | TVM creation (static) 
process where a set of TEE pages are assigned for a TVM to hold a TVMâ€™s 
global state. This routine also configures the global configuration that 
applies to the TVM and affects all TVM hart settings. For example, features 
enabled for this TVM, perfmon enabled, debug enabled 
etc.                                                                         

| teecall_tvm_shutdown                          | TVM shutdown verifies VMM 
has stopped all virtual hart execution for the TVM. The TVM virtual hart 
may not be entered after this point. The VMM may start reclaiming TVM 
memory after this 
point.                                                                       
  
| teecall_tvm_destroy                           | Verifies that the VMM has 
reclaimed all memory for the TVM and destroys the TVM - this operation 
returns the last allocated global structure page for the TVM - note that 
the page remains a page tracked by the TSM for TEE usage (for another 
TVM).                                                                        

| *TVM memory management* *operations* |

| teecall_tvm_page_convert_range                | Convert a memory region 
from non-confidential to confidential for a set of TVM pages.This operation 
initiates TSM tracking of these pages and also changes the encryption 
properties of these pages. These pages can then be selected by the VMM to 
allocate for TVM control structure pages, second stage page table pages, 
and TVM 
pages.                                                                       

| teecall_tvm_page_map_add_range                | Add one or more page 
mappings to the second stage translation structure for a TVM. The pages to 
be used for the second stage page table structures must have been converted 
(and tracked) by the TSM as TEE pages; otherwise this operation will not 
succeed.                                                                     

| teecall_tvm_page_map_remove                   | Remove a page mapping for 
a TVM page. The page mappings to be removed must be blocked before the 
remove operation will 
succeed.                                                                     

| teecall_tvm_page_add_pre_init                 | Add a page for an 
existing mapping for a TVM page - this add_pre must be performed before 
finalization of the TVM measurement via teecall_tvm_msmt_commit. For this 
operation, the VMM must provide the page contents that get copied into 
confidential memory pages for the TVM (and get tracked, encrypted etc). The 
contents of these pages are also measured via the teecall_tvm_msmt_extend, 
including the GPA at which the page is mapped. After the TVM msmt is 
finalized via teecall_tvm_msmt_commit, no more pre-add pages are allowed by 
the TSM for that TVM.                      

| teecall_tvm_page_add_post_init                | Add a zero page for an 
existing mapping for a TVM page (post initialization). This operation adds 
a zero page into a mapping and keeps the mapping as pending (i.e. access 
from the TVM will fault until the TVM accepts that 
GPA                                                                          

| teecall_tvm_page_range_block                  | Blocks a set of page 
mappings for an existing mapping for a TVM page. This operation prevents 
new TLB mappings from being created for a particular TVM page mapping. Note 
that stale TLB mappings may exist and those are invalidated by the TSM. The 
TSM enforces that mappings are blocked by the VMM before allowing any page 
relocation and/or page fragmentation 
operations.                                                                  

| teecall_tvm_page_range_unblock                | Unblock a set of page 
mappings for an existing mapping for a TVM page. Allows new TLB entries to 
be created - the VMM may perform this operation after it has invalidated 
the last set of mappings it had blocked via the teecall_tvm_fence 
operation.                                                                   

| teecall_tvm_page_relocate                     | Relocate a page for an 
existing mapping for a TVM page. This operation allows the VMM to reassign 
a new SPA for an existing TVM page mapping. The page mapping must be 
blocked and fenced before the page mapping can be 
relocated.                                                                   

| teecall_tvm_page_promote                      | Promote a set of small 
page mappings (existing mappings) for a set of TVM pages to a large page 
mapping. The affected mappings must be blocked before the promote operation 
can succeed. The VMM may reclaim the freed second stage page table page if 
the operation 
succeeds.                                                                    

| teecall_tvm_page_demote                       | Demote a large page 
mapping for an existing mapping to a set of TVM pages and corresponding 
small page mappings. The affected mapping must be blocked before the 
operation can succeed. The VMM must provide a free TEE-capable page to the 
TSM to use as a new second stage page table in the fragmented 
mapping.                                                                     

| teecall_tvm_page_reclaim                      | Reclaim a page (TVM page 
or second stage page table page). If the page being reclaimed is for an 
existing mapping, the mapping must be blocked (and invalidate mapping). The 
pages for a second stage page table structure may only be reclaimed after 
all mappings at that page table level have been 
reclaimed.                                                                   

| teecall_tvm_fence                             | Issue a TVM TLB 
invalidation (for the relevant harts) after a set of changes to the TVM 
mappings for confidential pages. The TSM enforces a hfence.gvma for the 
affected TVM vmid/asid to enforce stale tlb mappings are flushed. For 
implementations using memory tracking, this operation should also 
invalidate additional caching structures for page 
meta-data.

| *TVM virtual hart management operations* |

| teecall_tvm_vhart_add_init                    | This operation allows the 
VMM to assign TEE pages for a virtual hart context structure (VHCS) for a 
specific TVM. This routine also initializes the hart-specific fields of 
this structure.Note that a virtual hart context structure may consist of 
more than 1 4KB page. The number of pages are enumerated via the tsm_info 
call.                                                                        

| *TVM measurement operations*  |
| teecall_tvm_msmt_extend                       | This operation is used to 
extend the static measurement for a TVM for added page contents.The 
operation performs a SHA384 hash extend to the measurement register managed 
by the TSM on a 256 byte block of the page. The page must be added to a 
valid GPA mapping via the add_pre_init operation. The GPA of the page 
mapped is part of the measurement operation.The measurement process is a 
state machine that must be faithfully reproduced by the VMM otherwise the 
attestation evidence verification by the relying party will fail and the 
TVM will not be considered trustworthy.   

| teecall_tvm_msmt_commit                      | This operation enables a 
VMM to finalize the measurement of a TVM (static). The TSM enforces that a 
TVM virtual harts cannot be entered unless the TVM measurement is committed 
via this operation.

| *TVM runtime operations* |
| teecall_tvm_enter                             | Enter or resume a TVM 
virtual hart (on any physical hart). A resume operation is performed via a 
flag passed to this operation. This operation activates a virtual-hart on a 
physical hart, and may be performed only on a TVM virtual hart structure 
that is assigned to the TVM and one that is not already active. The TSM 
verifies if the operation is performed in the right state for that 
virtual hart.

| *TSM runtime operations* |
| teecall_ *tsm* _teeret                        | This operation is used by 
a TSM to return control to the OS/VMM via the TSM-driver TEERET flow.This 
operation may be used by the TSM in various scenarios - in response to a 
teecall_tg_* operation for requests to the VMM, or due to an S-mode 
interrupt that the TSM must report to the OS/VMM. It is also used to 
communicate faults in the second stage page table for a TVM etc.

=== TEEI - TG-ABI runtime interface

|===
| teecall_tg_drtm_extend       | This intrinsic is used by a TVM component 
to act as a dynamic root of trust of measurement (DRTM) for the TVM to 
extend runtime measurements. These measurements are managed by the TSM in 
the TVM global structure (To be specified TBD). These measurements are used 
in the TcbEvidenceInfo when the TVM attestation certificate is generated 
via teecall_tg_get_evidence.                                                 

| teecall_tg_get_evidence      | This intrinsic is used by a TVM to get 
attestation evidence to report to a (remote) relying party.It is supported 
by the TSM to provide HW-key-signed measurements of the TVM and the TSM. 
The attestation key used to sign the evidence is provisioned into the TVM 
by the TSM. The TSM certificate is provisioned by the FW TCB (TSM-driver 
and HW 
RoT).                                                                   

| teecall_tg_page_share        | This intrinsic is used by the TVM to 
request the conversion of the specified GPA to non-confidential (from 
confidential).The GPA must be mapped to the TVM in a present state, and 
must be scrubbed by the TVM before it is yielded. The TSM enforces that the 
page is not-present in the second stage page table and not tracked as a TEE 
page. The VMM owns the process of reclaiming the 
page.                            

| teecall_tg_page_accept       | Intrinsic used by the TVM to accept pages 
as part of initial (pre-init) load or post-init add/conversion of memory 
from non-confidential to confidential.The page mapping stays in a pending 
state (where TLB entries cannot be created) until this operation succeeds. 
The TSM enforces the page is zero-cleared during the page_post_add 
performed by the VMM when the page is (re)added back as a confidential TVM 
page.  

| teecall_tg_host_req          | This intrinsic is supported by the TSM to 
provide the TVM the ability to request host services e.g. para-virt IO.The 
TVM indicates to the TSM during this operation which x/v/f registers should 
be passed to the OS/VMM without clearing.

| teecall_tg_enable_debug      | This intrinsic is supported by the TSM to 
enable the TVM to request for debugging to be enabled for the TVM (TSM 
invokes TSM-driver to enable debugging if the TVM was created with debug 
opt-in; TSM enforces state save and restore of debug state for TVM hart).

| teecall_tg_enable_pmon       | This intrinsic is supported by the TSM to 
enable the TVM to request performance monitoring (where the TSM enforces 
state save and restore of the performance monitoring inhibit and trigger 
controls).
